Linear Regression using Single Variant : Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm where the predicted output is continuous and has a constant slope. It's used to predict values within a continuous range, (e.g. sales, price) rather than trying to classify them into categories (e.g. cat, dog).

Logistic Regression : Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms, which comes under the Supervised Learning technique. It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables. Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable.

KNN : The abbreviation KNN stands for “K-Nearest Neighbour”. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm. The algorithm can be used to solve both classification and regression problem statements. The number of nearest neighbours to a new unknown variable that has to be predicted or classified is denoted by the symbol 'K'.

Naive Bayes : Naïve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems. ... Naïve Bayes Classifier is one of the simple and most effective Classification algorithms which helps in building the fast machine learning models that can make quick predictions.

Decision Tree : Decision Trees are a type of Supervised Machine Learning (that is you explain what the input is and what the corresponding output is in the training data) where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter. ... The leaves are the decisions or the final outcomes.

Singular Value Decomposition : The singular value decomposition (SVD) provides another way to factorize a matrix, into singular vectors and singular values. ... The SVD is used widely both in the calculation of other matrix operations, such as matrix inverse, but also as a data reduction method in machine learning

Singular Value Decomposition on Image : SVD is an algorithm that factors any matrix A into three matrices UΣVT, where U and V are rotation matrices and Σ is a scaling matrix. One of its applications is image compression. SVD of an image matrix produces components of the final image. ... Image matching has several applications, such as panorama stitching.

Data Visualization : Data visualization is defined as a graphical representation that contains the information and the data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization techniques provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

K-Means Clustering : K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups). The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K. ... Data points are clustered based on feature similarity.
